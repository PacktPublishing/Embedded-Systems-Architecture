# Embedded Systems Architecture
This is the code repository for [Embedded Systems Architecture](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/embedded-systems-architecture?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788832502), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Embedded systems are self-contained units that have a dedicated purpose within a device. We come across a variety of applications of embedded systems in navigation tools, telecom applications, and networking equipment, to name just a few.
Embedded Systems Architecture begins with a bird's eye view of embedded development and how it differs from the other systems that you may be familiar with. You’ll first be guided to setting up a development environment and then move on to the core system architectural concepts, exploring pragmatic designs, boot-up mechanisms, and memory management. Next, you’ll look at the programming interface and device drivers to establish communication via TCP/IP and take measures to increase the security of IoT solutions. Lastly, you’ll be introduced to parallel multithreaded applications through the development of a scheduler.
By the end of the book, you will have explored various aspects of embedded architecture such as memory management, focusing on a memory-safe approach, multithreading, and the RTOS approach.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
}
```

It is expected that the reader is proficient in the C language and understands how computer systems work. A GNU/Linux development machine is required to apply the concepts explained. Going through the example code provided is sometimes necessary to fully understand the mechanisms implemented. The reader is encouraged to modify, improve, and reuse the examples provided, applying the methodologies suggested
